# question 4



```{r}
library(tidyverse)

prob2 <- read_csv( file = "Problem2.csv")
anova(lm(Response ~ FactorB*FactorA, data=prob2))
```


since the p value was 0.757035 which is > than 0.05 we can conclude that there is no signifanct interaction in the model. 

\newpage

# question 6

```{r}
anova(lm(Response ~ FactorB+FactorA, data=prob2))
```


According to the R output, both FactorA and FactorB are significant with p values lower than 0.05.In both cases we would reject the null hyothesis.
